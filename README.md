## Run Tests

I have added a script file for setting up environment, running test on val.csv PDF Files. 

```
sh env_setup.sh
```

**This Command will setup the environment and run the test.py file and save the results in "results" folder.**

Results are already added in results folder of val.csv.

**To see how this code works you can see the "test.py" file as an example.**
